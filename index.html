            <p>Does anyone out there want to help me along my learning journey?</p><br>
            <p>The courses videos are great but nothing beats knowing someone experienced who can directly answer any of your more specific questions.</p><br>
            <p>My latest project is to build a website for a ficticious client. I've been reviewing all the course material, trying to sponge it all up, but it takes a lot of time to sift through all of the course material; looking for the solutions to the problems I run into.</p><br>
            <p>English wasn't my best subject so forgive me if my grammar is horrible.</p>

            <p>Looking forward meeting you! In the meantime, I'll just keep sorting through my course videos or checking out the University of Youtube to see if I can find the answers I'm looking for.</p>
